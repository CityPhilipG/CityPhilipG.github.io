                <p> I am half greek and half german. I started programming in JavaScript at the age of 10
                    and then moved on to python. I've been particularly interested in Kali Linux
                    and penetration testing. During bootcamp I noticed how python made me take its syntax-simplicity
                    for granted, as Java proved to be a whole different monster. Apart from syntax, however, I find both
                    languages quite similar, though Processing made the GUI part way easier than in python.

                <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Mandelbrot Set</h3>
                <p>
                    This is my first programming project, created during the two week Bootcamp at City (2020).
                    The project depicts the Mandelbrot-set, named after Benoit Mandelbrot. It demonstrates an
                    understanding of quite a bit of maths, including complex numbers translated into code. It also
                    relies heavily on for-loops and if-statements, as the program iterates through functions for
                    every single pixel on the screen. The colouring of the set goes hand-in-hand with the number
                    of iterations it takes for a point to go towards infinity. The points withing the actual set, which
                    do not tend towards infinity are colored black. You can also move around within the set using "WASD",
                    as well as "z and x" to zoom in or zoom out. Lastly, you can switch the color set using "c and v".

                <h3>Philip Giavridis</h3>
                <p> I am a half greek and half german Computer Science student. Having read my first JavaScript programming book at
            the age of 10, I was hungry for more and moved on to Python. Soon after I discovered my passion for exploiting programs and finding vulnerabilities. During Bootcamp I started learning Java, a helpful addition to my coding
            repertoire. More than anything it showed me how I took syntax-simplicity in python for granted, as I had to spend time looking for missing colons at the end of my code! Processing was a great way to ease into this Language and was altogether a fun experience!

                <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Mandelbrot Set</h3>
                <p>
                    This is my first programming project, created during the two week Bootcamp at City (2020).
                    The project depicts the Mandelbrot-set, named after Benoit Mandelbrot. It demonstrates an
                    understanding of quite a bit of maths, including complex numbers translated into code. It also
                    relies heavily on for-loops and if-statements, as the program iterates through functions for
                    every single pixel on the screen. The colouring of the set goes hand-in-hand with the number
                    of iterations it takes for a point to go towards infinity. The points withing the actual set, which
                    do not tend towards infinity are colored black. You can also move around within the set using "WASD",
                    as well as "z and x" to zoom in or zoom out. Lastly, you can switch the color set using "c and v".
